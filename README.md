# Customer.io Expo Plugin

This is the official Customer.io Expo plugin, supporting mobile apps.

The Expo plugin takes advantage of our [React Native SDK](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-reactnative), and requires very little setup. It extends the Expo config to let you customize the pre-build phase of managed workflow builds, which means you don't need to eject to a bare workflow.

After you add the plugin to your project, you'll need to install our React Native SDK and run pre-build. The plugin automatically generates and configures the necessary native code files required to make our React Native SDK to work on your project.

# Getting started 

You'll find our [complete SDK documentation at https://customer.io/docs/sdk/expo](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/expo/).
